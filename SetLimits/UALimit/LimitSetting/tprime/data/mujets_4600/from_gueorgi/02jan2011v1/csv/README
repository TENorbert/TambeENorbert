2D histograms Ht(final state objects) vs Mreco, with 20 GeV binning:

TH2F(histN,"H_{t} fitted objects vs M_{reco}",45, 100, 1000, 90, 200, 2000)

The upper limits are such that for t' with Mt = 575 GeV, 
the events in overflow are at few permill level.

All MC background histograms are normalized to the data luminosity
using their production x-sections, for ttbar the CMS measurement is used.

Correction for trigger eff applied.
Btag SF applied on jet-by-jet basis for all MC samples.
Muon IdSF = 0.99 applied.

Single Top tW channel histograms for t and tbar are combined into one
histogram since their x-sections are identical.

All histograms for the t' signal are normalized assuming x-sect = 1 pb. 
The t' signal points cover the mass range 400 GeV - 625 GeV in 25 GeV intervals.

Fit conditions:

The number of input jets to the fit is 5 in case Njets > 4.

CSV btagger used.

v1 - consider only combinations in which a CSVm b-tagged jet is used as a b-quark
     and select from this subset the combination with min xi**2.

v2 - consider only combinations in which a pair of one CSVm and one CSVl b-tagged jets
     plays the role of the b-quark pair in the final state and
     select from this subset the combination with min xi**2.

v2_prob.01 - same as v2 with a cut on the best fit combination Prob(xi**2) > 1%
