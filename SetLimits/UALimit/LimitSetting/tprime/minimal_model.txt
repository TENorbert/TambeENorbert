Hi Gena,

I think as inputs just take Andrew-F¢s histograms for now. Make up -A
any uncertainty values that you need.

I think the minimum should be that you set the limit based on 
the mass spectrum in e+jets and mu+jets separately and combined. 
I suggest you constrain the ttbar component to the expected 
number of events +-10% (I am making up the uncertainties here 
right now %G-Fâ€“%@ we can substitute different values -A
later). Constrain the QCD background to expectations within an 
uncertainty (make something up) and you leave the W+jets 
background floating without constraint. Include at least one 
shape uncertainty (jes for example) for all sources. include the 
luminosity uncertainty and an efficiency uncertainty (relevant 
for the signal and the ttbar). I think these are the main 
ingredients. So to summarize you have the following components 
and uncertainties:
           ttbar xsection | QCD | jes | lumi | lepton efficiency |
ttbar      x              |  -  |  x  |   x  |       *           |
W+jets     -              |  -  |  x  |   -  |       -           |
QCD        -              |  *  |  -  |   -  |       -           |
tprime     -              |  -  |  x  |   x  |       *           |

- means does not apply
x means correlated for e and mu
* means uncorrelated for e and mu
